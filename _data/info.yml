# Info
why: "The only reason you are seeing this page is because I thought
I would enjoy making it. I did, but I also have other motivations for
creating this blog. Namely, I know that writing helps me to elucidate and organize my 
thoughts. Plus, it offers both physical organization 
and a living forum for my work.</br>&emsp;&emsp;I am very excited to start writing 
here! If you have any feedback, just send me an email. I look forward to hearing 
from you." 

what: "Here I'll write about topics that interest me, work that I've done,
and work that I am planning to do. At present, my main interests are 
in machine learning, probability, and analysis so there will be a lot on various
topics from those fields.
On the more hobbyist side, I want to write about my love for computers, 
emacs, vim, and LISP. We will see how it goes. 
This blurb will be updated as more content is added."

biography: "I'm a senior undergraduate at Tufts University earning my 
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. Currently, I work in the 
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology research group at Tufts. After graduating,
I plan to take a year off before heading to graduate school for Machine Learning.
I don't know what I'm going to do next year (besides applying for graduate school). One
might say I'm rather confused."
