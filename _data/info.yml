# Info
why: "The main reason you are seeing this page is because I thought
I would enjoy making it. I did, but I also have other, more practical reasons for
creating this blog. 
One is that I know that writing helps me to elucidate and organize my thoughts. 
Second is that this
blog will act as living documentation of my work. And finally, I hope that my 
perspective here will be valuable to some and at the very least, valuable to me."

what: "Here I'll write about topics that interest me, work that I've done,
and work that I am planning to do. At present, my main interests are 
applications of probability, analysis, and algebra to machine learning. 
 On the more 
hobbyist side, I want to write about my love for computers. I advocate that 
vim and emacs are human's greatest invention and that close behind, we have the unix 
philosophy and LISP. This is far from an exhaustive list. In reality, I will explore 
anything that interests me."

biography: "I'm a senior undergraduate at Tufts University earning my 
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. Currently, I work in the 
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology research group at Tufts. After graduating,
I plan to take a year off before heading to graduate school for Machine Learning.
I don't know what I'm going to do next year (besides applying for graduate school). One
might say I'm rather confused."
