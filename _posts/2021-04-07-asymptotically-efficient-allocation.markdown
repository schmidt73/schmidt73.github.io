We define our problem informally as follows. Given a set of slot
machines with unknown probability distributions develop a procedure
for play that minimizes the regret of the gambler. In the paper,
"Asymptotically Efficient Adaptive Allocation Rules" by Lai and
Robins, they define a lower bound for this regret, given that the
procedure is asymptotically efficient. We present this central result
here.
