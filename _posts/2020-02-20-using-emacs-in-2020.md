With the development of modern IDEs and their seemingly all
encompassing programming toolboxes, editors like emacs [^1] seem to be
a thing of the past. But modern editors fall short in that they fail
to themselves be programmable. Here I demonstrate unique emacs
functionality that this metaprogramming enables.

Vim integration
=====

To me, point and click text editing feels slow, tedious, error prone.
In addition, it is not easily extensible, in contrast to modal editors
like vim. Emacs has vim integration available through a plugin called
evil [^2], an "extensible vi layer for emacs." It was the first plugin
I installed when learning emacs and it made text editing feel
immediately at home.

M-x new-blog-post and metaprogramming
=====================================

Here, I illustrate the power of emacs to generate code and automate
repetitive tasks. I wrote a simple emacs function called
`(new-blog-post NAME)` that generates a new blogpost with a given name
automatically.  Here is a demo of it in use,

![New Blog Post](/images/posts/emacs_2020/new-blog-post.gif)

And here is the very simple elisp code I wrote for the command,

```elisp
(defun new-blog-post (name)
  (interactive "MPost name: ")
  (let* ((posts-dir "/home/schmidt73/Desktop/blog/_posts/")
         (post-file (concat posts-dir (format-time-string "%Y-%m-%d") "-" name ".markdown")))
    (find-file post-file)
    (insert "new-blog-post")
    (evil-append-line 1)))
```

If you don't know LISP don't worry, the code is relatively
straightforward. It autogenerates a file with the current date prefix
(dynamically generated) and `.markdown` suffix. Then, emacs jumps me
into insert mode within the file and after hitting tab, expands the
`new-blog-post` template that I created, asking me to fill out various
forms.

Let me make a few remarks on elisp more generally. After defining a
function in elisp, I can easily call the function from anywhere within
emacs, either interactively (like in the GIF) or from another piece of
code. If I wanted to automatically generate 10 blog posts, it would be
as simple as calling this function in a loop. Second, notice that the
configuration language is a complete programming language. Unlike
vim's vimscript, you can write real programs in elisp which is why
emacs has a great collection of libraries, plugins, and tooling
surrounding it.

As I don't create new blog posts very often, I admit that time has
probably been wasted automating the task. However, it serves as an example
emphasizing the power of emacs metaprogramming capabilites. If I have
some specific functionality I need, I can write a short function to do
it, and it seamlessly integrates into my text editor. 

SSH 
===

![TRAMP](/images/posts/emacs_2020/tramp.gif)

A text file in a remote location is little different than a file
stored locally. Emacs breaks this distinction through a mode called
TRAMP and allows you to easily access remote files as if they were
local, giving you the entire power of your local configuration on a
remote host. Assuming everything is configured correctly, even complex
features such as syntax highlighting, autocompletion, and file
navigation will be transparently managed.

File Navigation and Management
==============================

![File Navigation](/images/posts/emacs_2020/filenav.gif)

I spend a lot of time navigating and managing files. Renaming,
editing, copying, and deleting files are all part of my workflow. Most
editors don't attempt to help. They make the reasonable assumption
that you use your OS's file manager and load files into your editor
for editing. 

In emacs, you can save locations within files or directories as
bookmarks for easy access. There is a mode called Dired which serves
as a file manager. Fuzzy file navigation is supported through the
plugins helm, ivy, and ido. Emacs does it all.

Magit
=====

If you search the web for reasons to use emacs, Magit [^3] will pop
up. It is a complete interface to git inside of emacs. I won't waste
my breath advocating for it. It's very impressive.
