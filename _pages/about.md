![CLeslieLab](images/cleslielab.jpg)

I am a computer scientist turned computational biologist currently
taking a gap year in the Christina Leslie Lab at MSKCC. I study and
apply statistical, algorithmic, and machine learning methods to tackle
problems in biology. I am an incoming PhD student in the Department of
Computer Science at Princeton University.

**Currently** 

Working on projects associated with the genome editing technology
CRISPR:

* Developing a space-efficient CRISPR design tool based off a tool called Guidescan
* Evaluating current state-of-the-art gRNA libraries while developing our own using the tool
* Analyzing novel base-editing assay data and designing machine
learning methods for *in silico* base-editing outcome prediction
