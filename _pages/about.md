![CLeslieLab](images/cleslielab.jpg)

Computer scientist turned computational biologist currently taking a
gap year in the Christina Leslie Lab at MSKCC. I am interested in
applying statistical and algorithmic methods to tackle problems in
biology. Currently working on CRISPR editing tools and analyzing novel
base-editing assay data.
