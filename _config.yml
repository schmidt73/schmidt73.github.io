# About Me
why: "This is a blog about topics that interest me, work that I've done,
and work I am planning to do. If I have any aim with this site, it is that I <i>hope</i>
my perspective will be valuable to some. I feel I need to give back to the community 
that has given me so much."
what: "At present, my main interests are applications of probability, analysis, and 
algebra to machine learning. I want to be able to reason mathematically about the 
\"goodness\" of our algorithms. On the more 
hobbyist side, I want to write about my love for computers. I advocate that 
vim and emacs are human's greatest invention and that close behind, we have the unix 
philosophy and LISP. This is far from an exhaustive list. In reality, I will explore 
anything that interests me."
biography: "I'm a senior undergraduate at Tufts University earning my 
Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Mathematics. Currently, I work in the 
Bioinformatics and Computational Biology research group at Tufts. After graduating,
I plan to take a year off before heading to graduate school for Machine Learning.
I don't know what I'm going to do next year (besides applying for graduate school). 
If you have any ideas, I look forward to hearing your advice."
